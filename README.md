# SQL-Sales-by-product-customer-Analysis-----

        For many of us in the tech world, SQL (Structured Query Language) is the backbone of data management and analysis. It's a critical skill, whether you're a data analyst, software developer, business analyst, or a professional in virtually any field that relies on data.

Now, let's understand AtliQ's business model. In the industry, domain understanding is actually more important than technical skills.
 1. Gross monthly total sales report for Croma

Discription:-

As a product owner, I need an aggregate monthly gross sales report for Croma India customers so that I can track how much sales this particular customer is generating for AtliQ and manage our relationships accordingly.

The report should have the following fields,

Month
Total gross sales amount to Croma India in this month
SQL Query :-

SELECT
    S.date,
    ROUND (SUM(g.gross_price * s.sold_quantity),2) AS gross_total_price
FROM fact_sales_monthly s
JOIN fact_gross_price g
    ON g.product_code = s.product_code
    AND g.fiscal_year = get_fiscal_year(s.date)
WHERE customer_code = 90002002
GROUP BY s.date
ORDER BY s.date DESC

Result :-

date	gross_total_price
2021-12-01	$ 19537146.56
2021-10-01	$ 13908229.29
2021-09-01	$ 11192823.08
2021-08-01	$ 2349478.82
2021-06-01	$ 2288587.45
2021-05-01	$ 2181587.78
2021-04-01	$ 2253574.91
2021-02-01	$ 2355170.45
2021-01-01	$ 2303086.37
2020-12-01	$ 4078789.92

**2. Generate a yearly report for Croma India where there are two columns.**

Discription:-

Fiscal Year

Total Gross Sales amount in that Year from Croma

SQL Query :-

SELECT
    get_fiscal_year(s.date) AS Fiscal_Year,
    ROUND (SUM(g.gross_price * s.sold_quantity),2) AS gross_total_price
FROM
	fact_sales_monthly s
JOIN
	fact_gross_price g
ON
	g.product_code = s.product_code
AND
	g.fiscal_year = get_fiscal_year(s.date)
WHERE customer_code = 90002002
GROUP BY get_fiscal_year(date)
ORDER BY fiscal_year DESC

Result :-

Fiscal Year	gross_total_price
2022	        $ 44638198.92
2021	        $ 23216512.22
2020	        $ 6502181.91
2019	        $ 3555079.02
2018	        $ 1324097.44

**3. Created stored proc for monthly gross sales report.**

Discription:-

As a Business intelligence developer, I want to create a stored proc for monthly gross sales reports so that I don't have to modify the query every time manually. Stored proc can be run by other users (who have limited access to the database) and they can generate this report without having to involve the data analytics team.

The report should have the following columns,

Month

Total gross sales in that month from a given customer

SQL Query :-

CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `get_monthly_gross_sales_for_customer`(
	in_customer_code TEXT
)
BEGIN
	SELECT
		s.date,
		ROUND(SUM(g.gross_price * s.sold_quantity),2) AS gross_monthly_sales
	FROM
		fact_sales_monthly s
	JOIN
		fact_gross_price g
	ON
		g.product_code = s.product_code
	AND
		g.fiscal_year = get_fiscal_year(s.date)
	WHERE
		FIND_IN_SET(s.customer_code, in_costomer_code)>0
	GROUP BY s.date
	ORDER BY s.date DESC;
END


Result :-

date	gross_monthly_sales
2021-12-01	$ 19537146.56
2021-10-01	$ 13908229.29
2021-09-01	$ 11192823.08
2021-08-01	$ 2349478.82
2021-06-01	$ 2288587.45
2021-05-01	$ 2181587.78
2021-04-01	$ 2253574.91
2021-02-01	$ 2355170.45
2021-01-01	$ 2303086.37
2020-12-01	$ 4078789.92
2020-10-01	$ 3109316.88
2020-09-01	$ 2296919.63

2020-05-01	$ 145049.05
2020-04-01	$ 130520.92


**4. Stored proc for the market badge.**

Discription:-

Create a stored proc that can determine the market badge based on the following logic, If the total sold quantity > 5 million that market is considered Gold else it is Silver.

My input will be,

Market
Fiscal Year
Output

Market badge
SQL Query :-

CREATE DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `get_market_badge`(
	IN in_market VARCHAR(45),
    IN in_fiscal_year YEAR,
    OUT out_badge VARCHAR(45)
)
BEGIN
	DECLARE qty INT DEFAULT 0;
    #If value not given for market assume like default market is India
    IF in_market = "" THEN
		SET in_market = "India";
	END IF;
    #Retrive total qty for given market and fiscal year
	SELECT
		SUM(s.sold_quantity) AS total_qty
	FROM fact_sales_monthly s
	JOIN dim_customer c
	ON s.customer_code = c.customer_code
	WHERE
		get_fiscal_year(s.date) = in_fiscal_year AND
        c.market = in_market
	GROUP BY c.market;

    #Determine market badge
    IF qty > 5000000 THEN
		SET out_badge = "Gold";
	ELSE
		SET out_badge = "Silver";
	END IF;
END

set @out_badge = '0';
call gdb0041.get_market_badge('india', 2021, @out_badge);
select @out_badge;
